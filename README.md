# CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design - Winter 2023

## Course Overview

This repository houses my coursework for CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design, offered in Winter 2023 at UC Santa Cruz. The course provided a deep dive into the intricacies of computer system design, covering essential topics such as concurrency, synchronization, client-server models, HTTP servers, and more. Through a series of progressively challenging assignments, I have developed a solid understanding of how to design, implement, and manage complex computer systems efficiently.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Command-line Memory
- **Objective:** Implement a program that interacts with files in a Linux directory, providing get and set functionalities.
- **Key Concepts:** Linux system calls, file I/O buffering, memory management, string parsing.
- **Technologies:** C programming, Ubuntu 22.04.

### Assignment 2: HTTP Server
- **Objective:** Develop a basic HTTP server capable of handling GET and PUT requests.
- **Key Concepts:** Client-server model, HTTP protocol, string parsing, memory management.
- **Technologies:** C programming, socket programming.

### Assignment 3: Bounded Buffer
- **Objective:** Create a synchronized, multi-threaded bounded buffer system.
- **Key Concepts:** Concurrency, synchronization, FIFO queue implementation.
- **Technologies:** C programming, pthreads.

### Assignment 4: Multi-Threaded HTTP Server
- **Objective:** Enhance the HTTP server from Assignment 2 with multi-threading capabilities to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Key Concepts:** Multi-threading, thread safety, audit logging, client-server concurrency.
- **Technologies:** C programming, pthreads, HTTP.

## Key Takeaways

Through these assignments, I have gained valuable experience in:
- Designing and implementing systems that efficiently manage concurrency and synchronization.
- Developing robust server applications that adhere to the HTTP protocol and handle multiple client requests in parallel.
- Utilizing low-level programming constructs in C to manipulate files, manage memory, and create networked applications.
- Debugging and optimizing system-level code to enhance performance and ensure reliability.
