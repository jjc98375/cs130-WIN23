# CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design - Winter 2023

## Course Overview

This repository contains all my assignments for the CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design course, taught in Winter 2023 at UC Santa Cruz. The course offered an in-depth look at computer systems' design and implementation challenges and standard solutions to address complexity, concurrency, performance, and more.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 0: Development Environment Setup
- **Objective:** Set up the development environment and familiarize with submission practices.
- **Key Concepts:** Basic C programming, development environment setup.
- **Technologies:** C programming, Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine.
- **Outcome:** Created a simple program that outputs "Hello World!" to the terminal and attested to setting up an Ubuntu 22.04 VM for development and testing.

### Assignment 1: Command-line Memory
- **Objective:** Implement a command-line program for get/set memory abstraction of files.
- **Key Concepts:** Linux system calls, file I/O buffering, memory management, string parsing.
- **Technologies:** C programming.

### Assignment 2: HTTP Server
- **Objective:** Build a basic HTTP server supporting GET and PUT requests.
- **Key Concepts:** Client-server model, HTTP protocol, string parsing, memory management.
- **Technologies:** C programming, socket programming.

### Assignment 3: Bounded Buffer
- **Objective:** Construct a bounded buffer with synchronization between multiple threads.
- **Key Concepts:** Concurrency, synchronization, FIFO queue implementation.
- **Technologies:** C programming, pthreads.

### Assignment 4: Multi-Threaded HTTP Server
- **Objective:** Enhance the HTTP server with multi-threading capabilities.
- **Key Concepts:** Multi-threading, thread safety, audit logging, client-server concurrency.
- **Technologies:** C programming, pthreads, HTTP.

### Assignment 5: Caching Simulator
- **Objective:** Implement a cache simulator supporting various eviction policies.
- **Key Concepts:** Caching algorithms, FIFO, LRU, and Clock eviction policies.
- **Technologies:** C programming.
- **Outcome:** Developed a cache simulator that efficiently manages memory access and processing, reducing the number of disk reads and redundant computations.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout these assignments, I have:
- Mastered system-level programming in C, focusing on memory and thread management, file I/O, and network communication.
- Gained practical experience in designing and implementing client-server applications and understanding HTTP protocols.
- Explored advanced concepts in concurrency and synchronization, building a multi-threaded web server and a cache with various eviction policies.
